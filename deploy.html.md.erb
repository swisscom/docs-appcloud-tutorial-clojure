In this step you will deploy the app to <%= vars.product_full %>.

Before we can push it, we need to compile the app using Leiningen. To do so, run

<pre class="terminal">
$ lein uberjar

Push your app to the cloud by executing the following command and replacing the "my-random-hostname" with your own hostname. This will be part of the URL your app will be reached at and it has to be globally unique so be creative.

The `-b java_buildpack` tells Cloud Foundry to use the Java buildpack for our app and the `-p target/cf-sample-app-clojure-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar` tells Cloud Foundry where to find the compiled application to push to the Cloud.

The application is now deployed. Ensure that the app is running:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf app my-clojure-app

Now visit the app at the URL. You can find the URL in the `urls` property of the statement above.
