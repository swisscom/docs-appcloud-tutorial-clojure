<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

In this step you will deploy the app to <%= vars.product_full %>.

Push your app to the cloud by executing the following command and replacing the "my-random-hostname" with your own hostname. This will be part of the URL your app will be reached from and it has to be globally unique so be creative. The `-b java_buildpack` tells Cloud Foundry to use the java buildpack for our app and the `-p target/cf-sample-app-clojure-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar` tells Cloud Foundry where to get the repository of our application to push to the Cloud.

The application is now deployed. Ensure that the app is running:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf app cf-sample-app-clojure

Now visit the app at the URL. You can find the URL in the `urls` property of the statement above.
