<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

In this step you will deploy the app to <%= vars.product_full %>.

First compile the application using the command:

<pre class="terminal">
lein uberjar
</pre>

This will compile the application creating a jar standalone file that can be pushed to Cloud Foundry.
Push your app to the cloud by executing the following command and replacing the "my-clojure-app" with your own hostname. This will be part of the URL your app will be reached from and it has to be globally unique so be creative. 

The `-b java_buildpack` tells Cloud Foundry to use the java buildpack for our app and the `-p target/cf-sample-app-clojure-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar` tells Cloud Foundry where to find the compiled application to push to the Cloud.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-clojure-app -b java_buildpack -p target/cf-sample-app-clojure-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

The application is now deployed. Ensure that the app is running:

<pre class="terminal">

Now visit the app at the URL. You can find the URL in the `urls` property of the statement above.
