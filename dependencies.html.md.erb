<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<%= vars.product_short %> uses the Java buildpack to execute the uploaded JAR file as application package. The Java buildpack will run your application using the `main()` method from the `core.clj` file.

The dependencies needed for the application are stored in the `project.clj` file and are included in the standalone JAR during the compilaton phase. When you create a new project with Leiningen, the file `project.clj` is created automatically. To add new dependencies to the project, simply modifiy the file accordingly.

The demo app you deployed already has a `project.clj`, and it looks something like this:

```clojure
(defproject cf-sample-app-clojure "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "Sample Clojure application for Cloud Foundry"

  ...

  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]
                 [compojure "1.5.1"]
                 [ring/ring-defaults "0.2.1"]
                 [ring/ring-jetty-adapter "1.5.0"]
                 [hiccup "1.0.5"]]

  ...

  :main cf-sample-app-clojure.core
  :aot [cf-sample-app-clojure.core])
```

The `project.clj` file determines both the version of Clojure that will be used to run your application on <%= vars.product_short %>, as well as the dependencies that should be installed with your application.

To install the dependencies, compile the project with:

<pre class="terminal">
$ lein uberjar
2016-04-05 09:41:09.060:INFO::main: Logging initialized @3611ms

Created /.../cf-sample-app-clojure/target/cf-sample-app-clojure-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
</pre>
